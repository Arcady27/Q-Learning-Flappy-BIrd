# Q-Learning-Flappy-Bird
Q-learning implementation to learn the agent play game Flappy Bird.

Neural network is coded using Keras library with **Theano** backend (it doesnt' work with Tensorflow backend).
Some additional libraries are needed.

To watch how bird is learning and playing run: **python qlearn.py**
