# Q-Learning-Flappy-Bird
Q-learning implementation to learn the agent play game Flappy Bird. Algorithm is based on DQN by DeepMind (https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/). Python implementation of Flappy Bird game is taken from https://github.com/TimoWilken/flappy-bird-pygame with added client module.
Neural network is coded using Keras library with **Theano** backend.

# Requirements
* Theano
* Keras
* Numpy

# Installation and setup
To watch how bird is learning and playing, run command: **python qlearn.py**
